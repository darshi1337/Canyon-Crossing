Improved version of the Chrome Dino game with interesting gameplay and challenging obstacles

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment
for notes on deploying the project on a live system.

### Goals

  - Changing the Protagonist from Dino to Cowboy to induce better and interesting gameplay as we can give some useful traits and powerups to Cowboy.
  - Adding more colors into the game to make the game more lively
  - Adding obstacles like TNT’s, ceilings (to avoid excessive abuse of jump control), bigger and risky jumps etc.
  - An actual ending to the game – It can be done by adding enemies and bosses throughout the gameplay. As the player progresses further the difficulty increases and so as the abilities of the Cowboy.
  - Having multiple endings – For example Good and Bad endings. Each ending will have a different approach.
  - Point system – After every level we can give points or stars to the player. It can improve the understandability of the game.
  - Sound effects – For various activities such as reloading a gun to jumping can be captured and inserted in the game.
 - (P.S. - All these Goals were not achieved during the DebugIt contest conducted by IIT BHU. I will definitely continue in future.)
